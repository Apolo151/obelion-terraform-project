# AWS Infrastructure for WordPress Autoscaling Using Terraform

This repository contains Terraform code to provision a highly available, modular AWS environment for hosting a WordPress site. It automates the creation of:

- A custom VPC with public and private subnets
- A Launch Template based on your WordPress AMI
- An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) of t3.small instances behind a Load Balancer, with CPUâ€‘based scaling
- A MySQL 8 database in a private subnet
- Remote state management in S3

All components are organized into reusable modules, enabling clean separation of concerns and easy maintenance.

### Setup
- Ensure you have Terraform installed on your machine. If not, you can download it [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- Ensure you have the aws CLI installed on your machine. If not, you can download it [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
